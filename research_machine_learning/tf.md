We will tour the code that you have just downloaded with some explanations of what each part does.  We include links to more details to help you understand the concepts in a broader context

# What libraries are required?

# Command Line Parameters

# Lists of models and sources

# Ask for a model and/or source if they didn't come from the command line

# Load a TensorFlow Lite Interpreter and name its input and output tensors

# Go through each source frame

# Run the model to create a prediction

# Convert the output Tensor to a prediction

discussions and examples of what is going on when tensor flow code is run on the pi
